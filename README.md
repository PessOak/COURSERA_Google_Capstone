The Case Study follows the 6 Steps Data Analysis Process taught throughout the Course

## Introduction
In recent years, wearable devices have undergone a remarkable metamorphosis, evolving from basic step counters into comprehensive health and lifestyle companions. These smart gadgets now offer an array of functionalities, from heart rate monitoring to sleep analysis and even stress management. 

As we gaze into the future, the trajectory of wearables appears set to further blur the lines between technology and human experience. Forecasts suggest real-time health diagnostics, proactive disease prevention, and the integration of augmented and virtual reality into our daily lives. 

Furthermore, wearables are forging stronger connections with the broader ecosystem of smart devices. The fusion of wearables with the Internet of Things (IoT) promises seamless, synchronized living.

The graph below shows the growth of the wearable devices market in recent years and projections for the future

## 1- Ask
Business tasks: 

a) Identify the business task -> The task is to transform raw smart device usage data into actionable insights that can guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy, enhancing their product positioning and communication efforts in a way that aligns with current consumer preferences and behaviors in the smart device market.

b) Consider key stakeholders -> Urška Sršen (chief creative officer) and Sando Mur are the primary stakeholders. And Bellabeat’s marketing analytics team are the secondary stakeholders.

## 2- Prepare
There are 18 CSV files available from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius) that can be used for the project. This Kaggle dataset contains personal fitness tracker from 30 Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

We will use SQL as our main tool for the Process and Analyze phases. As for the Visualization phase we will be using Tableau to create customized graphs.

## 3- Process
Data limitations observed:

•	The total of users that provided data is 33, it’s a small sample size, because of that, the final results and findings may not be very reliable or useful;
•	The data is from 2016 and this project is happening in 2023. So, it might be outdated and may not reflect the real scenario nowadays;
•	It would be useful to have gender information for this project for the company’s (Bellabeat) main audience and consumers are women in general, but we don’t have that.
